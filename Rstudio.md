## RStudio

*Here you'll find a variety of data visualization projects I've developed. I've used sports data for fun as I've moved through the learning process with R.*

In this visualization, I was curious about strength of schedule plotted against season point differential. What I found interesting was that teams with nine of the top ten upcoming picks in the NFL Draft were grouped together! (A pair of teams have two picks in the top ten as of today.) I also found it funny how Tom Brady's two teams were so similar in this regard.

Here I visualized performance of Wisconsin Badger quarterbacks since the beginning of the the Barry Alvarez era. Basically, Russell Wilson was as great as we remember him being.

Prior to Super Bowl LVI, I thought it might be interesting to see how teams perform by quarter. The Rams actually led the league in points allowed in the fourth quarter!
