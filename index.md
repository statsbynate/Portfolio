## Welcome!

Here's what you're going to find in this corner of the web.

- #### [Personal Curiosities & Musings](personal.md)
    - These are projects I've created along the way which I use to learn things like SQL, R, [Tableau](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/nathanjwelsch), etc. These also feed my curiosities and are projects that I find to be fun!
- #### [Class Projects](class.md)
    - Through my journey of obtaining a MBA in Business Analytics from the University of North Texas, I have a variety of single and group projects to share which I believe display important data science skills such as data cleaning, data wrangling, applied statistics, machine learning, and much more. 
- #### [Professional Projects](professional.md)
    - You'll find a handful of projects here that I've created during my professional journey.
